## Summary

I'm aiming to learn programming becouse it becomes my passion and hobby now. I like to optimize common routine, make things better, search in process repeating patterns and automate them becous it save a lot of time, money and prevent of making mistakes.

## Skills

Currently I'm applying some basic JS skills in vba programming for ms excel. I'm implementing some features for productivity and comfort. It brings a lot of positive users expirence and satisfaction. Earlier I made a couple totally new versions of consulting company website (each one was placed on hosting for a rather long period of time). This website doesn't need to have any extraordinary features but last revision uses bootstrap 4, Font Awesome, connection to yandex/google/fb statistic, have a couple of js and php scripts, php page composing, connection to db, and simple handmade integration to amoCRM (and a lot of other what have been forgotten).
